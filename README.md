# cube

A Rubik's Cube solver.

This package is a rough implementation of Kociemba's algorith, which is documented at length on the [Cube Explore website](https://kociemba.org/cube.htm).

I have not implemented all of the bells and whistles that exist in Cube Explorer, but I have implemented the core of the two phase algorithm, and it works!
